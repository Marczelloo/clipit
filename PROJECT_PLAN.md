T3 Stack Video Processing & Discord Clips App Implementation Plan
Project Overview
You're building a T3 stack application for video processing that allows users to:

Cut videos
Compress videos with custom settings
Store and organize clips by Discord servers and users
Tech Stack
Framework: T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, Tailwind)
UI: ShadCN UI components
Auth: Discord OAuth
Video Processing: FFMPEG (via ffmpeg-wasm or server-side processing)
Storage: Options discussed below
Database: Probably PostgreSQL with Prisma

Implementation Plan
1. Project Setup
    npx create-t3-app@latest my-video-app --typescript --tailwind --trpc --prisma --nextAuth --postgresSQL

2. Authentication & Database
    Set up Discord OAuth in Next Auth
    Create database schema with Prisma:

3. Storage Solution Options
    Local storage (development only)
    Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible, cheaper than S3)
    Backblaze B2 (very affordable)
    Supabase Storage (free tier available)

4. API & Backend Features
    Discord integration to fetch user's servers and members
    Video processing endpoints using FFMPEG:
    Cutting
    Compression with parameters
    File upload/download endpoints

5. Frontend Implementation
    Layout & Navigation

    Main dashboard
    Server/user clip browser
    Video editor
    Video Processing UI

    Video cutting interface with timeline
    Compression settings form
    Upload workflow
    Clip Management

    Server selector (fetched from Discord)
    User clips gallery
    Video player component
    
6. Discord Bot Integration
    Create a simple Discord bot
    Add commands to share clips
    Handle embed rendering for shared links
    
Development Roadmap
    Phase 1: Foundation
    [x] Project setup with T3 stack
    [x] Discord authentication
    [x] Basic database schema
    [x] File storage implementation

    Phase 2: Core Features
    [] Video processing functionality
    [] Clip upload/download
    [] Server and user clips browsing
    
    Phase 3: Polish & Advanced Features
    [] Advanced video editor UI
    [] Discord bot integration
    [] Embeddable player
    [] Performance optimizations
     
    Technical Considerations
    Video Processing:
    Client-side: Use ffmpeg.wasm for in-browser processing (good for small files)
    Server-side: Use FFMPEG on backend for larger files (more reliable)
    
    Storage:
    Consider file size limits
    Implement expiration policy if needed
    Set up proper CORS for external access
    Discord Integration:

    Need Discord Developer application
    OAuth2 scopes for user identity and server membership
    Bot permissions for server interaction
